# 공원

##  공원 묘사


My favorite park is Han River Park.

It is a public park located near Seoul.

The park is very large.

And there are bike paths and exercise equipment in the park.

So when I go to the park, I usually bring a water bottle and a bicycle.

I usually ride my bike or walking every weekend.

I usually go to the park on weekends.

I like riding my bike or jogging there.

The park is big and has nice paths for exercise.

It’s a great way to stay active and enjoy fresh air.

I always feel refreshed after spending time there.


##  공원에서 있었던 뜻밖의 경험

Recently, I went to a park near my house to relax and enjoy the weather.

The park was clean and peaceful, with lots of trees and open space.

I took a walk, sat on a bench, and listened to the sounds of nature.

It was a great way to clear my mind and feel refreshed.

I really enjoyed the time there and plan to visit again soon.

## 자전거 묘사

My bike is all black.

It is a road bike. 

I use It because it is lightweight.

I bought my bike at a store near my house.

It was very cheap. so I am happy with purchase(퍼처스).


## 자전거 타게된 계기

When I was a student.

I bought a bicycle to go to school.

It started because it was cheap.

The experience of riding a bicycle was much better than I thought(떠ㄸ).

So even after graduation, I still enjoy riding my bike in the park.

Last weekend, I rode my bike around the park.

The weather was sunny, and the **breeze** felt great. (브리즈 산들바람)

I enjoyed the view of trees and people relaxing.

It was peaceful, and I like this atmosphere.(앳모스피어)

I want to ride a bike again.
