## 1. 공원 묘사


My favorite park is Han River Park.

It is a public park located near Seoul.

The park is very large.

And there are bike paths and exercise equipment in the park.

So when I go to the park, I usually bring a water bottle and a bicycle.

I usually ride my bike or walking every weekend.


## 4. 공원에서 있었던 뜻밖의 경험

Recently, I went to a park near my house to relax and enjoy the weather.

The park was clean and peaceful, with lots of trees and open space.

I took a walk, sat on a bench, and listened to the sounds of nature.

It was a great way to clear my mind and feel refreshed.

I really enjoyed the time there and plan to visit again soon.

# 자전거

## 자전거 묘사

My bike is all black.

It is a road bike. 

I use It because it is lightweight.

I bought my bike at a store near my house.

It was very cheap. so I am happy with purchase(퍼처스).


## 자전거 타게된 계기

When I was a student.

I bought a bicycle to go to school.

It started because it was cheap.

The experience of riding a bicycle was much better than I thought(떠ㄸ).

So even after graduation, I still enjoy riding my bike in the park.
