# 해변

## 좋아하는 해변, 이유

I really like Haeundae Beach.

It is a famous beach in south Korea.

when I need to clear my mind with my friends, I go there often.

It has beautiful white sand and very delicous seafood.

So I eat delicious seafood all day with my friends.

whenever I go there, I always have a lot of fun.


## 해변갈때 가져가는것.

> 키워드 :: simple, suncrip, sensitive skin, extraclothes.

when I go to the beach.

The simple one is best.

I don't have a lot of load.

Take the suncrip.

because I have sensitive skin.

And I pack extra clothes.

That's all.


# 캠핑

## 캠핑중에 하는 일

There is a nice valley near Gwangju.

It has a nice campsite.

I go there with my family a few times a year.

First, I usually set up a tent with my father.

Next, I prepare a meal. Like 김치찌개 soup.

in the evening, We all have barbecue together.

## 캠핑 여행에서 기억에 남는 경험

when I was young.

I went camping on 무등 Mountain with my family.

At night, I was surprised by the beautiful night sky.

Everything is different. It's amazing.

And the sunrise was also incredible.

I'll never forget that memory.
