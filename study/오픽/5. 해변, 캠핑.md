I really like Haeundae Beach.

It is a famous beach in south Korea.

when I go to the beach.

The simple one is best.

I don't have a lot of load.

Take the suncrip.

because I have sensitive skin.

And I pack extra clothes.

That's all.


## 해변 경험

Last summer, I visited a 해운대 beach with my friends.

We swam in the ocean and played games on the sand.

The sound of the waves and the sunset were so relaxing.

We also had a barbecue and seafood.

It was one of the best days I’ve ever had.

## 캠핑 여행에서 기억에 남는 경험

when I was young.

I went camping on 무등 Mountain with my family.

At night, I was surprised by the beautiful night sky.

Everything is different. It's amazing.

And the sunrise was also incredible.

I'll never forget that memory.
