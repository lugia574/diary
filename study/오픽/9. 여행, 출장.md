Before the trip,

The simple one is best.

I don't have a lot of load.

I usually pack my things simply

And I go to bed early.

I like keeping it simple and easy.

## 처음 해외여행을 갔던 장소, 시기, 사람

when I was 10 years old.

I went on a trip abroad for the first time.

I went to Tokyo with my famliy.

we visited many traditional temples.

I took a lot of pictures.

It is very interesting experience.

## 기억으로 남는

Recently, I visited a park while traveling abroad.

The park was clean and peaceful, with lots of trees and open space.

I took a walk, sat on a bench, and listened to the sounds of nature.

I loved experiencing nature in a new place.

It was a memorable visit, and I hope to go back someday.
