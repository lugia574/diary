## 요즘 날씨 묘사

The weather these days is a bit cold.

The mornings and evenings feel chilly, but the afternoons are warmer.

It’s sunny most of the time, with clear blue skies.

I like wearing a light jacket when I go outside.

It’s the perfect season to enjoy a walk in the park.

## 예전과 지금 날씨 변화

The weather feels different from when I was younger.

Winters seem warmer, and summers feel much hotter.

We also get heavy rain more often than before.

I think climate change is affecting the weather a lot.

It makes me worry about the future.


## 날씨 때문에 생긴 경험

One day, it suddenly started raining heavily while I was outside.

I didn’t have an umbrella, so I got completely wet.

I ran to find shelter, but it was too late.

It was uncomfortable, but I laughed about it later.

Now, I always check the weather before going out.

## 재활용

I don't know about recycling.

Because when I throw away the trash, I throw it away as I tell you to throw it away there.

I just followed the instructions.

Can here... Plastic over there...

That's all.

So I have nothing to say about recycling.

## 재활용 경험

Experience with recycling?

I don't have any memorable recycling experience.

I just followed the instructions.

That's all.
