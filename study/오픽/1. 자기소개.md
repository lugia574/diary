> 키워드 :: Gwangju, peaceful place, hiking, seoul

Hi, I'm Cheol Wook Lee.

I was born in Gwangju, South Korea.
Gwangju is a beautiful city and a peaceful place to live.

It’s surrounded by amazing mountains and forests.
I have fond memories from my young, 
especially(이스페셜리) spending a lot of time hiking and jogging there.

Recently, I moved to Seoul, and I’m looking for job.
